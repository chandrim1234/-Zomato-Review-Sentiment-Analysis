# -Zomato-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
Here’s a comprehensive project description for Zomato Review Sentiment Analysis based on typical components of such projects. This outline should align well with your uploaded notebook file.


# Project Title: Zomato Review Sentiment Analysis
# Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze customer reviews of zomato, a leading food delivery service, to understand customer sentiment. The analysis aims to categorize reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, extract actionable insights, and support Swiggy in improving customer experience and satisfaction.

# Problem Statement
zomato receives a large volume of customer reviews daily across platforms such as its app, website, and social media. These reviews often contain valuable feedback regarding delivery speed, food quality, app usability, and customer service. However, manually processing and analyzing these reviews is impractical. Automating sentiment analysis can help:

- Identify key areas of improvement.
- Gauge customer satisfaction trends.
- Enable proactive issue resolution.

# Proposed Solution
Implement a sentiment analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The system will process customer reviews, classify sentiments, and visualize insights for business decision-making.

# Methodology
1.Data Collection
- Source: Collect reviews from zomato app, website, or public datasets.
- Data Format: Ensure data includes review text, star ratings, and metadata such as location and timestamp.

# Data Preprocessing
- Remove noise (HTML tags, special characters, URLs).
- Tokenize and lowercase text.
- Apply lemmatization or stemming.
- Handle missing or null data.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand word distributions and sentiment trends.
Visualize most frequent positive/negative words using word clouds.
Analyze review lengths, ratings, and time-based trends.
Sentiment Labeling

Rating-Based Labels: Map star ratings to sentiment categories (e.g., 4–5 stars = positive, 1–2 stars = negative, 3 stars = neutral).
Manual Labeling: Manually label reviews for additional training data.
Feature Extraction

Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for classical models.
Pre-trained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT) for deep learning.
Model Development

Train sentiment classification models:
Classical ML: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest.
Deep Learning: LSTM, GRU, or Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa).
Fine-tune pre-trained Transformer models for better accuracy.
Model Evaluation

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Perform cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Insights Extraction

Highlight common complaints (e.g., “late delivery,” “cold food”).
Analyze positive sentiments (e.g., “excellent service,” “hot and fresh food”).
Identify regional or time-based patterns in sentiments.
Visualization

Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualization.
Create sentiment distribution plots, word clouds, and time-series sentiment trends.
Deployment

Deploy the model as a REST API for real-time sentiment analysis.
Integrate with BI tools like Power BI or Tableau for business reporting.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLTK, SpaCy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, BERT
- Deployment: Flask/FastAPI, Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure
Outcomes
Customer Sentiment Reports: Categorize reviews into positive, negative, and neutral.
Actionable Insights: Identify areas for operational improvement (e.g., delivery time, food packaging).
Real-Time Analysis: Enable real-time review analysis for immediate feedback monitoring.
Improved Customer Experience: Use insights to tailor services and improve satisfaction.
